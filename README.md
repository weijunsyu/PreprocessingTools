# Preprocessing Tools
Python scripts for pre-processing data

## Image preprocessing:
1. **Image cleaning: _clean_image.py_**
    - Cleans up images such that images without useful data are discarded, and all images are converted to rgb or greyscale format
    - Image metadata is stored in a csv file along with a flat version of each image (in its own csv file)
