Scripts for pre-processing data


## Image preprocessing:
1. Image cleaning: clean_image.py
    - Cleans up images such that images without useful data are discarded, and all images are converted to rgb or greyscale format
    - Image metadata is stored in a csv file along with a flat version of each image (in its own csv file)
